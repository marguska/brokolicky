<h3>About us</h3>
<h4>Who are we & why did we start?</h4>
<p>We are two girls, Margo & Nika, that are in love with Kof√≠ (which means coffee, if you are confused). We noticed that the other one is always drinking a different type of coffee, so we decided that each of us will try a new type of coffee than the one we usually drink. At that point, we decided that it would be an interesting idea to make a site where we can share our experiences about how much we liked a specific type of coffee.</p>
<h4>What is the point of this page?</h4>
<p>We would like people that visit our page to have an overview of what types of coffee exist or which one they would like to try out. On our page we mostly share our opinions about different types of coffee and which ones we liked/enjoyed the most or the least. We love to share a new point of view and inspire people to make their opinions about coffee.</p>
